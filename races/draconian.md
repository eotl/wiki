description: Descendants of Dragons - Fierce in Mind and Claw.
---
The Draconians are descendants of the dragons of old.  They are great reptilian beings, but not nearly as great as their ancient ancestors.  The Draconians have been around for many aeons.  They have great talents as both powerful fighters and learned casters.  Slow, but sure, is the way of the Draconian.
