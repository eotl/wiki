Example : bug When I try to look at the fountain, I get a 'Wtf?'.

     This command is used to report small bugs and errors you
encounter whilst adventuring.  If the bug is important, or dangerous, 
please notify a wizard right away.  Using this command will help make
EotL a better mud.

     Please make sure you are in the area the bug occurred when
you use this command!  Telling Eternal Cabal about the problem in
Africa helps nobody.
