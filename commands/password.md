Command : Password.
Format  : password

     This command allows you to change your password.  Passwords must
be 6 characters in length or longer.  For safety's sake, it is 
recommended your password not be a standard dictionary word, and that 
you use capital letters, numbers, and other non-letter characters in it.

     Should you forget your password, please talk to an IC member.
