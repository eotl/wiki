Command : Rest.
Format  : rest || sit
 
     At the rest state, players gain hitpoints and fatigue back at
accelerated rates.  Resting is also the only way to restore mana,
apart from with healing items.  While resting, you cannot move, wear
or remove armor, wield or unwield weapons, cast many spells, use many
skills, search, begin following somebody, or start combat.
