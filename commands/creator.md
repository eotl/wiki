Command : Creator.
Format  : creator || creator &lt;item&gt;
Example : creator gnarled staff
          creator elven merchant

     The 'creator' command is used to display the coders of an item.
Typing it by itself will target the room you are in, or you may direct
it towards a weapon, piece of armor, monster, or other object.  This command
is useful when a player is attempting to report a bug in a piece of code,
as who to mail is readily apparent.
