     The 'creator' command is used to display the coders of an item.
Typing it by itself will target the room you are in, or you may direct
it towards a weapon, piece of armor, monster, or other object.  This command
is useful when a player is attempting to report a bug in a piece of code,
as who to mail is readily apparent.
