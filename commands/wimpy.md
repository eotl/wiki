Command : Wimpy.
Format  : set wimpy &lt;number&gt;
Example : set wimpy 50

     By setting your wimpy to a particular number, you are instructing
your player to automatically flee if your hitpoints fall below that
number.  A wimpy level of zero will result in no auto-fleeing by your
character, and is known as "brave" mode.

    When setting your wimpy, consider that some monsters are able to drag
you back into several more combat rounds as you are attempting to flee.
Wimpy is a bonus function for players.  It is *not* failsafe.  Note that
you will NOT be unkilled if you die because your wimpy did not work.
