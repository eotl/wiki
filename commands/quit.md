Command : Quit.
Format  : quit

     The 'quit' command saves your character and removes you from the game,
closing the connection between EotL and your remote machine.  If you are
carrying any items or money when you quit, you will be forced to drop them.

     Quitting at an Inn or in the Lounge will save your entry position there.
Thus, the next time you log into EotL, your character will enter the game at
that place.

     Note that you cannot quit while in combat.
