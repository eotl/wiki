Command : Line Wrap.
Format  : set wrap on || set wrap off

     If your player has 'wrap' set on, whenever a line of text which is
greater than 79 characters in length is printed to your screen, the game
will attempt to break it into smaller lines for easier reading.  This 
function should help players who use terminals that do not support 
word wrap or other wrapping functions.
