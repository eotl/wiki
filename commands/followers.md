Command : Followers.
Format  : followers

     This command will list the players and monsters who are currently
following you, and whether or not you have allowed them to do so.  In
addition, it also lists the players and monsters following these
people, in a tree-like fashion.  In effect, everyone on the list will follow
you when you leave the room, should they also be in there.
