Format  : reply &lt;msg&gt;
Example : reply Thanks for that tell, Gunthar.  This is a reply.

    Reply allows you to return a 'tell' to whoever told you something last.
When you are told something by anyone, it saves who told you in your body,
and, if you 'reply' with a message, it goes to them.  You don't have to
type in a player's name.

    "reply -a &lt;msg&gt;" is used for replying to tells for more than one
person.  Only "reply -a" sends the reply to everyone who got the previous
message as well as the original teller, e.g.:
    
    One tells you, Two, Three, Four: Later.
    reply -a see ya
    You tell One, Two, Three, Four: see ya
