Command : Room Brief
Format  : set room-brief [on | off]
 
     Setting room briefs on will decrease the amount of scroll when moving
quickly between rooms.  The long description for each room will not be
displayed.  When having room-brief on, it is best to leave brief mode 'off'
so that conversations with other players are seen in verbose mode.  This
gives players the best of both worlds, in that they can run quickly from
area to area without a lot of screen output, yet still see verbose output
from their conversations with others.

     It is not recommended for players adventure to unknown areas with
brief on.
