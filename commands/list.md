Command : List.
Format  : list || list &lt;argument&gt;
Example : list locations

     The 'list' command will display your hit locations, your proficiency 
levels, your resistances, your skill levels, or your stats.  Typing &lt;list&gt;
by itself will show the valid arguments for the command.

     The displays for proficiencies and skills both follow a similar format.
They will display as follows:

Name: Effective Level (Bonus Amount)

If you currently don't have any bonuses then it will not display anything
after the Effective Level.
