Command : Glance.
Format  : glance || glance &lt;thing&gt; || glance at &lt;thing&gt; || glance in &lt;thing&gt;
Example : glance fountain

     Virtually the same as the 'look' command, glance will respect having
brief on.  Thus, if you glance at a room and have &lt;set brief on&gt;, you will
see only the short description and the contents of that room.
