Command : Page Length
Format:   set page-length (<number>/auto)

     This value should be the height of your terminal window, in
characters.  This is mainly used by the paging system, so it can show
you a full screen of text at a time.  The default is to attempt to
automatically determine your screen height, but if you want to override
it, you can set it to a number.  Autoterm must also be set on for
automatic screen dimension querying to work.
