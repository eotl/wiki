Command : Save.
Format  : save

     This command allows you to manually save your character's data to
your savefile.  Whilst your data is automatically saved every 10 minutes
or so, and upon quitting, player death, and scheduled shutdowns, a mud
crash could cause your data to revert to the last automatic save.  It is
wise to manually save each time your character is changed.  Such
instances would include completing a quest, joining a guild, and raising
stats.
