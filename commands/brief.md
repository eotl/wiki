Command : Brief.

     Setting brief on will decrease your screen scroll, as you will nolonger
see the long descriptions of rooms as you explore the mud.  Brief mode also
causes some response messages, such as those from the 'say' command,
to be shorted to 'Ok.'

     It is not recommended players adventure to unknown areas with brief on.
