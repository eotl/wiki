Command : Junk.
Format  : junk &lt;object&gt;, junk &lt;all object|inv|env&gt;, junk &lt;all&gt;

     Junking an object will destroy it forever.  Pretty useful, huh?  It
is considered good etiquette to junk corpses after killing monsters, so as
not to leave piles of junk around.

     Junk all object gets rid of all that type of object, e.g. swords or
shields.  Junk all inv junks everything in your inventory.  Junk all env
junks everything in your environment.  Junk all just junks everything.
