Command : mbeep
Format  : mbeep <player>
Example : mbeep valentino
 
   This will let you beep players if they have been idle for over 2 minutes.
A player will only be beeped once every 5 (or so) seconds no matter how many
times they are beeped, or how many different people beep them.  Also, players
may use 'set nobeep on/off'.  If nobeep is on, other players cannot beep you.

Note:  If you're a mortal and you beep a wizard, you are at their mercy.
