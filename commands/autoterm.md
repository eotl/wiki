Command : Autoterm
Format  : set autoterm (on/off)

     If your telnet/mud client supports it, EotL can communicate
with it, and determine things such as the dimensions of your screen,
and your terminal type (vt100, ansi, etc).  This defaults to on, 
but if you find that it isn't working properly, you can turn it off.

See also: set, ansi, page-width, page-length
