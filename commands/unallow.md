Command : Unallow.
Format  : unallow <who> || unallow <all>

     If you have players following you who you have allowed to do so,
you may <unallow> them also.  Once a player is unallowed, there is a
far greater chance they will lose you during your movements from room to 
room.  Should you wish to unallow everybody that is following you, 
<unallow all> can be used.
