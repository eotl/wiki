Command : Unallow.
Format  : unallow &lt;who&gt; || unallow &lt;all&gt;

     If you have players following you who you have allowed to do so,
you may &lt;unallow&gt; them also.  Once a player is unallowed, there is a
far greater chance they will lose you during your movements from room to 
room.  Should you wish to unallow everybody that is following you, 
&lt;unallow all&gt; can be used.
