Command : Follow.
Format  : follow &lt;who&gt; || follow me || follow stop

     The 'follow' command allows you to follow any player or monster as 
she / he / it moves about the mud.  The follow command is particularily
helpful when several players are grouped and wish to adventure together.

     To begin following someone you must be in the same room as them.
To be most effective, that player should &lt;allow&gt; you to do so.  While
following someone you do not lose the ability to move under your own command.

     To check who you are following, type &lt;follow&gt;.

     To stop following, type &lt;follow me&gt; or &lt;follow stop&gt;.  Both of these
will allow you to move around entirely under your own influence again.  You do
not have to be in the same room as the person or monster to stop following them.
