Command : Ansi Shorts.
Format  : set ansi-shorts on || set ansi-shorts off

     The small, descriptive first line of each room is known as its
'short description.'  Some wizards use ansi to color that description,
and if you set ansi-shorts on, your terminal will use that color when 
displaying the line.  

     You must also have ansi set on to see the color of ansi-shorts.
