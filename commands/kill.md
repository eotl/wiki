Command : Kill.
Format  : kill &lt;monster&gt; || kill &lt;player&gt; || kill all
Example : kill elf

     If you are not already in combat, the 'kill' command will 
initiate it between you and the monster or player that is the target of
your command.

     If you are already in combat, using the 'kill' command targeting
another monster or player will change the target of your attacks.  It is
only possible for you to attack one being at a time.

	If you use 'kill all', you will attack all non-player, living items
in the room that you could normally attack.
