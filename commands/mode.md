Command : Mode.
Format  : mode &lt;mode&gt;
Example : mode say
 
     The mode command puts you in a "mode," where all commands you type
will be appended to &lt;mode&gt; first.  So if you did &lt;mode say&gt;, you would
say anything that you typed.  Typing &lt;**&gt; or &lt;.&gt; on an empty line will
take you out of mode.  
 
NOTE:  If you want to escape out of mode you will need to use a double
bang (ie. &lt;!!look&gt; instead of just &lt;!look&gt;).
